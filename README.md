# vue-win-3.1

This is a small proof of concept Vue application that emulates the look and feel of Windows 3.1.

##  Why?

Partly "just because" but also to act as a starting point for a modern Vue app that will imitate early 90's hypertext programs.

## Credits

Thanks to Matthijs Lanser for creating the [Windows 3.1 GUI CSS styling](https://codepen.io/m-lanser/pen/wzYjJQ) which I used as a starting point for this.
